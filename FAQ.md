## Text doesn't automatically paste after I close neovim

This is by design currently. The readme has a blurb about this at the top.

```
Once invoked, nvim-anywhere will open a buffer. Close it and its
contents are copied to your clipboard and your previous application is
refocused.
```

While this feature may be added in the future, for compatibility sake,
it'll be optional or opt in.
